•  Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  The client, DriverPass, was aiming to create a system to help facilitate and educate people wishing to pass driving exams easier. This would include the ability for both online practice tests in addition to on site practical exams. 

•  What did you do particularly well? 
I believe I identified the potential limitations of the requirements given by the owner.
 
•  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
I would spend more time on the UML diagrams, detailing out everything that I feel that I would like to include. However, overdetailing can lead to readability issues, so a middle ground would have to be achieved.

•  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I read through the transcript thoroughly, both checking back to confirm if the comments made were either the owner or the requirements gathering team. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing, because sometimes the person requesting the software (in this case the owner) may miss key details that would adversely affect the end user.

•  How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software like any task given to me, I first read through and try to understand what the task needs to be performed at its most basic level. Afterwards, breaking it down into more detailed parts and then their relationships with each other are laid out.
